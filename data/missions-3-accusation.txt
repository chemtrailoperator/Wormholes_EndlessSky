We have received intelligence that a pirate force is en route to attack this system and they will be here any moment. We've gotten all the ships we can, but we can barely match their numbers and we could certainly use your help. Will you join us? The authorities can pay you quite well."`

Several of the militia pilots also approach to thank you by name before dispersing to their ships, apparently you are somewhat well known around here. As you take off together, you can't help but wonder how many will not survive the imminent battle...`

			`	You are placed in a police motorcade and driven to the large court building in the largest city of Bourne.

The officer behind you pushes you through and closes the door behind you.`

You take a seat and the judge, an enormously fat man, begins speaking. "Good afternoon Captain <last>, we understand that you do not currently have legal council, but this is only a preliminary hearing and it will not be necessary.

			`	There is a map of the ring opposite the entrances from the human pads. It clearly directs you to your destination, "Offices of Free Worlds - Chief Representative" It isn't a long trip with the transportation systems built into the ring.`
			`	The capsule, human-sized and comfortable, doesn't even feel like it is moving, but within a minute, you have reached your destination. The door slides open to reveal a large wood-panelled room with doors marked for each faction.`

			`	The door opens immediately when you try the handle, revealing another transportation pod. As you step in, the door closes behind you, but only briefly, opening again to reveal a different room decorated in a style common in the South. A metallic voice speaks from the ceiling; "There are currently no other delegates present." The room contains a few couches, a bar, a long table, and several doors.`

			`	You find your room among the others. It is simple and neat, with a small bed and a table. Blank shelves and empty cupboards line the walls. You'll have to get some books to fill them. At the back of the room there is another door leading into another room that is a closet on one side and a bathroom on the other. You find your way back out to the main room.`
				goto conferencereturn
			label offices
			`	You go through the door and follow the signs to your office. You open the door and are stopped in your tracks. One wall of your office, ten feet high and at least sixteen wide, is a clear unbroken window with a view across the section of the ring containing the wormhole back to human space. It is a stunning view, the fluctuating pinks and purples of the wormhole standing out against the black of space.`
			`	You stand captivated by the view until a change shocks you out of your reverrie. A little dot in the middle of the wormhole becomes brighter and brighter until it disappears in an instant. Just as suddenly, the center caves in and a ship rockets out. It stabilizes and you recognize it, a Carrier. It is in normal Republic colors, but with quite abnormal weaponry. What turrets it has are mostly defensive. The ship lights its engines, Korath in origin, and passes out of view heading towards a nearby section of the ring.`
			`	You look around to get the other details of the room. The opposite side is lined floor to ceiling with bookshelves, empty, while a desk and chair stand in one corner. The other corners contain small tables with chairs next to them. Sitting on the desk is a model of your flagship on a stand, perfect in every detail. The stand has a plaque reading Captain <first> <last>, Chief Representative, Free Worlds. A screen rises up out of the seemingly solid wood of the desk. A quiet chime plays and words scroll across the screen. "Representative Stephen Sills, Assistant for the Republic, has arrived at the ring."`
			`	The door opens on its own as you approach and you find your way back to the common room.`
			`	Sills is sitting at the bar with his back to you. He throws back a large drink and turns around, slipping off his stool quickly. "Hello <last>," he says coldly, "Remember my cousin?" Before you can form a reply he pulls out a handgun, points it at you, and fires.`
			`	You watch in slow motion as the bullet approaches, a simple little cylinder of metal flying directly towards your head despite the distance. A few feet away from your face, a sheet of translucent blue appears from nowhere and the bullet shatters into tiny fragments upon it. The sheet disappears as quickly as it came. You both stand for a moment in shock before any action can be taken.`

				goto engagement
			label fired
			`	In the time it takes you to draw your pistol and fire, Sills fires a few more rounds, all of which are stopped by the mysterious shield with deafening cracks. Your energy bolts, travelling much faster, take longer to be intercepted, only stopping a few inches from his face in bright flashes. "THOSE DAMN QUARGS!" He shouts, and charges at you, tossing his pistol aside. It looks like its going to be a close engagement.`
				goto engagement

			`	You run at him as he fires a few more rounds, all of which are destroyed by the mysterious shield with deafening cracks. "THOSE DAMN QUARGS!" He shouts, and charges at you too, tossing his pistol aside. It looks like its going to be a close engagement.`
			label engagement
			`	In the seconds it takes to close the distance in the room, you have time to consider your options for attack and defense. He is much taller and broader than you, with longer arms, but you suspect that he is not as light on his feet as you.`

				`	(Go low.)`
					goto low
				`	(Go High.)`
			`	You close with tremendous force. You throw a punch towards his head, but he parries it easily and jabs with his other hand, hitting the left side of your face with enough force to knock you backward. He follows up with a powerful kick to your chest that sends you flying backward into the edge of a table. He draws a long, slim knife from his waistband and leaps on top of you. He sends the knife speeding towards your chest, but the blue shield appears yet again and the tip of the knife snaps against it. He brings his hand back to strike again, but you get a hand free to block. The jagged tip of the knife bites into your forearm, but you get your other hand free.`

			`	Going for his legs proves to have been a good choice. You kick one of his knees and he loses his balance for a second. He doesn't let you push the advantage. As you close he turns and throws a spinning kick at your head, which you only barely block. He follows up with a powerful kick to your chest that sends you flying backward into the edge of a table. He draws a long, slim knife from his waistband and leaps on top of you. He sends the knife speeding towards your chest, but the blue shield appears yet again and the tip of the knife snaps against it.

				goto rollchoice

			`	This time, he feints a punch and delivers a slicing kick into your abdomen. You swing for his head, but he ducks under it, spinning his body to set up powerful hook that almost knocks you out. Suddenly he is at your side. He sticks a leg in front of you and shoves you over it, planting a kick in your lower back as you fall which lays you out fairly effectively. There is a zapping sound and his body crashes down next to you, quivering.`
			`	A Hai face leans into your field of view as it bends over you. Its face distorts and trembles queasily as it sniffs disdainfully. "You must improve your fighting skills if you are to continue in this line of work." It reaches down and lifts you to your feet.`

Soon, he emerges with a first aid kit and begins to wrap you forearm with bandages. The door to the transport tube revealing a hunched Quarg holding a small box. It glances around the room, taking notice of the shell casings, the weapons, and the trail of blood you've left, and the Hai's taser. It walks over to Sills, still lying on the ground, and pulls a device out of the box. It wraps the device around his wrists.`
			`	"I see you had the opportunity to use your Galactic Keystone's defense mechanisms. Seeing that you have no clue what he is talking about, the Hai continues, "In the interest of protecting the delegates, the Galactic Keystone has a tiny shield matrix built in. Its not quite like the one in your ship though, its completely invisible except when it activates, and it is able to stop projectiles yards away. Due to the constraints of having something surrounding you all the time, the Keystone only reacts against lethal force. That's why you got cut up the way you did."`
