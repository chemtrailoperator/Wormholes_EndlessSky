# The idea of this is a storyline that allows you to pick assistant delegates for the FW.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------ Start of first delegate story. --------------------------------------------------------
# Mission where you meet another Free World's officer that claims acquaintance through some battle. He tells you he plans to retire soon and asks you to put in a word for him if you hear of any jobs for an adventurous pilot.
# Mission where you meet him again, and he asks you for a ride. If you accept, it leads you to a conversation where he asks about the Galactic Keystone, if you do not provide information, he persists.
