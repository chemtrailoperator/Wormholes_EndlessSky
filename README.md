# Wormholes
The Wormholes plugin is a content addition that allows you to serve as a galactic diplomat once you have visited every civilization (and subculture).
The perks of being a diplomat include access to a massive network of wormholes that allow access to every faction.

Currently requires Endless Sky v0.10.16
Many updates coming soon with diplomacy missions.
